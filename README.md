React 19 introduces Actions. These functions replace using event handlers and integrate with React transitions and concurrent features.

Actions can be used on both the client and server. For example, you can have a Client Action which replaces previous usage of onSubmit for a form.

Rather than needing to parse the event, the action is directly passed the FormData.
